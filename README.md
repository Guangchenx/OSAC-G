# OSAC-G

This repository for the paper "Green Cell-free Massive MIMO: An Optimization Embedded Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach".

# Introduction

This repository implements a new algorithm that embeds non-convex optimization into contemporary deep reinforcement learning (DRL), referred to as optimization-embedded soft actor-critic with graph transformer networks (OSAC-G). OSAC-G enjoys the benefits of directly online inferring solutions for the non-convex problem with a much lower computational complexity compared to conventional non-convex optimization.
